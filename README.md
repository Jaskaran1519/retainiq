This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## What is used

In this project, i used Nextjs 14, Tailwind CSS and Framor motion. Actually i read the almost a day late and didnt know how to implement the rearranging of rows and didnt have enough time to reseaarch so i just used framor motion to somehow make that work.
I used some components from shadcn and hyper ui to speed up the process
As there was not enough time and didnt want to miss the deadline to didnt work that much on the responsiveness of this page on all devices.

The task is live at https://retainiqjaskaran.vercel.app/
